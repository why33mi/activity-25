Overview

This project implements machine learning models to predict heart disease status based on various health indicators. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis.

Features
Data preprocessing with one-hot encoding for categorical variables

Decision Tree classifier with depth optimization

Random Forest classifier with different feature selection strategies

AdaBoost classifier with Decision Tree base estimator

Feature importance analysis using:

Model-specific impurity metrics

Permutation importance on both training and test sets

Requirements
Python 3.7+

Required packages:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib
